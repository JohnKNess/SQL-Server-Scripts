        ADMIN_Retrieve_Statistics_Info_Outdated_and_Update.sql 
        
        Small non-parameterized statement to retrieve statistics that have 
        become outdated and may or may not be triggered by SQL Server's 
        "auto update statistics" algorithm.
        
        The script will also list whether or not the trigger value has
        been reached or not for both the newer 2016 and the older 2014 
        algorithm.
